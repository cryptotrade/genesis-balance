# genesis-balance
Very simple script to analyse the Genesis mining payouts.



## Requirements
  - Python 3 (requires pandas)
  
# Usage
$ python genesis.py FILENAME




# Filename requirements

The code takes a tab-separated-file containing the payouts from Genesis Mining. An example file is provided. You just have to copy and paste your payouts into a .txt file and it should work out-of-the-box.
